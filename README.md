# comp4128
# week 1 : general stuffs like brute forces , search , greedy some intro level problem solving tactics
#
# week 2 : data structure intro : point update/query on segment tree , use of set , map , and a little bit on sweeping
#
# week 3 : graphs problem , BFS , DFS , SCC , bellman-ford , dijstra , floyd
#
# week 4 : more on segment trees , with focus on representing range on trees (using DFS order) , LCA(just like sparse table) , lazy propogation on range updates , more on sweeping
#
# week 5 : DP , and DP with date structures
#
# week 6 : max-flow , binary search technique (some problem can be reduced to decision problem , and Bsearch answer , find property with monotonicity first
#
# week 7 : more max-flow , dynamic programming optimization (mainly focus on convex hull trick)
# more to come !!
